# Formulation of search problem:
# The problem is built into a graph with the nodes as cities and road segments as edges.
# Now we have to search a path from the start city to end city based on the additional information given by the user.

# State space: All list of cities and junctions constitute the total state space.
# Successor function: Cities and junctions connected to a particular city/junction are the successors
# of that city/junction.
# Edge weights: Depending on the type of routing option, the edge weights could either be the distance, time,
# segment(weight of 1) or scenic(weight of highway distance of a road)

# Heuristic:
# Heuristic function is only used in A*.
# Segment and Distance heuristic – Calculate the haversine distance between the current state and goal state.
# This is admissible because the haversine distance will give the minimum distance between the two states given that a
# straightline road(curve) exists between the two states.
# Time: Since time = distance/speed,take the min distance possible and max speed possible to guarantee an underestimate.
# Since dataset has max speed limit as 65, 65 is used as the speed limit.
# Scenic: Here we check a possible outgoing routes and if any of them is scenic, it will return 0,
# else if all are highways then it will take the minimum of the available highway distances.
# This is admissible because if there is at least one outgoing scenic route there is a possibility that
# future all roads to the destination would be scenic and thus the heuristics is accurate at 0.
# If all are highways, then we know that no matter what the minimum value added now to the highway distance
# would be the minimum of the available highways to take.
#
# How the algorithm works:
# BFS: Keep traversing the nodes in BFS order and print when destination is found.
# DFS: Keep traversing the nodes in DFS order and print when destination is found.
# IDS: Keep traversing the nodes in IDS manner, increasing the depth by 1 for every iteration
# and print when destination is found.
# A*: Implemented A* using the heuristics as defined above.
#
# Assumptions/simplifications:
# Since latitude and longitude of junctions are not given, we have calculated them by using the formula:
# Summation of |total_of_connecting_segments – length_of_each_connecting_segment|  /total_of_connecting_segments
# Answers:
# 1) A* seems to work best since it selects the next node to visit by taking the best available option.
# 2) A* seems to work the fastest because since it selects the best available option, it reaches the destination faster.
# 3) IDS uses the least amount of memory
# 4) Refer above for heuristic functions.
# 5) Tete_Jaune_Cache,_British_Columbia is the farthest city from Bloomington,_Indiana. (The code for this is commented out at the bottom)
